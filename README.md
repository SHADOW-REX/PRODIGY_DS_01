<h2>Task 01: Visualizing Data Distribution</h2>

<p>
📄 <b>Description</b>
  <br>
  For my first task, I was assigned to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. I chose to work with the Cost of Living Index data to demonstrate my ability to   handle and visualize categorical data effectively.
<br><br>
📚 <b>Dataset</b>
  <br>
  Sample Dataset: I selected the Cost of Living Index by Country dataset from Kaggle. This dataset includes various details about the cost of living index in different countries.
<br><br>
📅 <b>Categorical Data Selection</b>
  <br>
  I focused on the Main Cost Of Living Index column to analyze the distribution of the cost of living index across various countries.
<br><br>
🔍 <b>Data Analysis in Python</b>
  <br>
  Data Import: Imported the dataset using Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation.
  Data Cleaning: Ensured the data was clean and formatted correctly for analysis, handling any missing or inconsistent data.
  Count Calculation: Used Python to calculate the frequency distribution of the Cost of Living Index across countries.
  Visualization: Created a bar chart using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize this distribution clearly.
<br><br>
🛠️ <b>Steps to Create the Chart</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Data Import:</b> Loaded the dataset using Pandas.</li>
  <li><b>Data Cleaning:</b> Cleaned the data, focusing on the Cost of Living Index column, ensuring accuracy for analysis.</li>
  <li><b>Frequency Calculation:</b> Calculated the distribution of the Cost of Living Index across countries using Pandas. Also calculated the distribution for Top 10 most Expensive and Cheapest Countries to live in.</li>
  <li><b>Chart Creation:</b> Used Seaborn’s sns.barplot to create a bar chart representing the distribution.</li>
  <li><b>Chart Customization:</b> Customized the chart with appropriate titles, axis labels, and colors to enhance readability and aesthetics.</li>
  </ul>
<br>
📈 <b>Output</b>
  <br>
  The resulting bar charts and histograms effectively displays the distribution of the Cost of Living Index across different countries. This visualization helps in understanding which countries have higher or lower cost     of living, providing insights into global economic trends.
<br><br>
🎯 <b>Impact</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Data Understanding:</b> Improved understanding of the distribution and trends in the cost of living across countries.</li>
  <li><b>Visualization Skills:</b> Enhanced skills in creating and customizing visualizations using Python.</li>
  <li><b>Analytical Skills:</b> Strengthened ability to analyze categorical data and derive meaningful insights.</li>
  <li><b>Skill-Up:</b> Improved data handling skills by using Seaborn python library which i was not familiar with previously.</li>
  </ul>
